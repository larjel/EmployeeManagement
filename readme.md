This is a simple employee management program written in Java. Data is entered and read via the command prompt (using Scanner for input). All data is held in volatile memory.

Some of the things you can do:

- Add employees of different kinds.
- Update employee information.
- Show information about a specific employee.
- Remove an employee.
- Calculate salary and bonus for each employee.
- Provide statistics of various kinds based on the information we have about employees.
